# Uncommon React Native Build Error: Third-Party Library Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in React Native related to the integration of third-party libraries. The error is not consistently reported but arises from incompatibilities between different versions of dependencies or incorrect configuration of the library.

## Problem

The main issue is the lack of a clear and consistent error message. The reported errors are often vague and require detailed debugging to find the root cause.  It typically manifests as a failure during the build process (Android or iOS), but sometimes only surfaces as unexpected behavior in the app.

## Solution

The solution requires carefully examining the library's integration instructions, verifying the correctness of native module linking, checking dependency versions for conflicts using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`, and exploring the platform-specific logs (Android build logs or Xcode build logs) for more specific hints.

This example shows a simplified scenario, but real-world scenarios can be far more complex.
