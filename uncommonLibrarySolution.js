The primary solution is methodical debugging.  Start with ensuring that the library's installation instructions are followed precisely.  Carefully check your package.json and ensure all versions are compatible.  Use the library's documentation to check linking procedure (Android - `react-native link`, manual linking; iOS - Cocoapods or manual linking).  If the library's documentation is incomplete or unclear, explore similar libraries or try to find solutions online (Stack Overflow is a good resource).

If you are still facing the problem, carefully examine the complete build logs (Xcode or Android Studio) for detailed information.  The exact line numbers and error messages will provide valuable clues.

Consider using a dependency graph tool (like `npm ls` or `yarn why`) to detect conflicting versions of dependencies.  If you find conflicts, try downgrading or upgrading the relevant packages or libraries. 

Sometimes, cleaning your project's build cache (`react-native clean`) might help.

For extremely stubborn issues, you might need to create a minimal reproducible example, isolating only the necessary code to reproduce the problem.  This will enable more targeted debugging.
